# Chatbot Formatting Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the AddisWheels chatbot with proper text formatting to improve readability and user experience.

## Improvements Made

### 1. MessageFormatter Component
Created a new `MessageFormatter` component in `src/components/Chatbot.tsx` that handles:

- **Numbered Lists**: Renders numbered steps with blue circular badges
- **Bullet Points**: Renders bullet points with blue dots
- **Sub-bullet Points**: Renders indented sub-bullets with gray dots
- **Bold Text**: Converts `**text**` to `<strong>` elements
- **Section Headers**: Styles lines ending with ":" as blue headers
- **Important Notes**: Highlights warnings with yellow background and border
- **Empty Lines**: Adds proper spacing between sections

### 2. Enhanced System Prompt
Updated the system prompt in `src/lib/gemini.ts` to include:

- **Formatting Guidelines**: Clear instructions for the AI on how to structure responses
- **Example Formatting**: Shows the AI exactly how to format different types of content
- **Response Structure**: Guidelines for step-by-step processes, key points, and warnings

### 3. Visual Improvements
The formatted messages now display with:

- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between different content types
- **Color-coded Elements**: Blue for headers, yellow for warnings, gray for sub-items
- **Proper Spacing**: Consistent margins and padding for readability
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, modern styling that matches the platform design

Okay, here's a breakdown of what you need to rent a car on AddisWheels:

1. Browse Vehicles: Start by searching and filtering available cars on the AddisWheels platform. You can filter by car type, location, price, and other criteria.

2. Vehicle Details: Once you find a car you like, view its details, including images, the owner's contact information, and the price per day.

3. Select Dates: Choose the start and end dates for your rental period.

4. Calculate Price: The total price will be calculated as: (price per day) x (number of days).

5. Make Booking: Confirm your booking. The platform will check for any date conflicts with existing bookings for that vehicle.

6. Contact Owner: After booking, use the built-in chat system to communicate directly with the vehicle owner. This is important! You'll need to discuss payment arrangements and vehicle handover details directly with them.

Important Considerations:

* AddisWheels is a connection platform only. We don't handle rental payments or vehicle handovers. You must arrange these directly with the vehicle owner.
* Communication is key! Use the chat system to clarify all details with the owner before your rental begins.

1. **Registration & Verification:**
   * First, you need to register an account on AddisWheels.
   * After registering, you'll need to get your account verified. This usually involves submitting a copy of your ID. This is important for security and trust on the platform.

2. **Creating a Listing:**
   * Once verified, log in to your account.
   * Navigate to the "List a Vehicle" section.
   * Fill in all the required details about your car:
     * **Brand** (e.g., Toyota)
     * **Model** (e.g., Corolla)
     * **Year** of manufacture
     * **Price per day** (in ETB)
     * **2-4 Images** of your car (make sure they are clear and show the car from different angles)

3. **Payment (If Applicable):**
   * Remember, free users get 3 free listings. If you've already used those, you'll need to pay for your listing.
   * The cost per listing is 500 ETB.
   * You can choose a payment method: Telebirr, CBE Birr, Amole, Bank Transfer, or Cash.
   * Alternatively, you can subscribe for unlimited listings (Monthly, Quarterly, or Yearly plans).

4. **Admin Approval:**
   * After you submit your listing (and payment, if applicable), it goes to the AddisWheels admins for approval.
   * The listing status will be "PENDING."
   * Admins will review the details and images to ensure everything is accurate and meets the platform's standards.
   * You'll receive a notification when your listing is either "APPROVED" or "REJECTED."

**Important Notes:**

* **Verification is mandatory** before you can list any vehicles.
* Make sure your **images are clear and representative** of your car.
* All listings require **admin approval** before they go live.
* Double-check all the **details** you enter to avoid rejection.
